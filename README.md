## Usage

### Loading dataset from Python

- Its usage is quite similar to `keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()` function.
- The argument represents the path to `moonboard.npz` to be loaded.
- The return values are same as `keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()`.

```python
>>> from datasets.load_moonboard import load_moonboard
>>> (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = load_moonboard('./datasets/moonboard.npz')
>>> print(x_train[0])

>>> print(y_train[0])
  10
```
